            <p>Hello! My real name is Eliezer but people rarely knows me by my real name. People know me by "Koki", a nickname that my mother gave me. I enjoy making new videos, playing video games, boxing, and taking a nap. I was born in the Philippines and I am full Filipino. Foods that I enjoy are ramen, raw and exotic foods that would give me a thrilling experience. As for my education, most of my education was from the Philippines. Now, I am aiming to be a Web Developer.
